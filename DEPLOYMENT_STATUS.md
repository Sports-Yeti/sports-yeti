   - Middleware aliases may not be configured correctly
   - JWT authentication guard configuration needs verification

2. **JWT Configuration**: 
   - JWT secret generation timed out
   - Auth guard configuration may be incomplete
   - Middleware registration needs verification

3. **Missing Models**: Some referenced models not created
   - `Permission` usage in User model but model not defined
   - `Division`, `Equipment`, `ChatPollVote` models stub implementations

#### **Frontend Mobile App**
1. **Import Errors**: Screen imports reference non-existent files
   - Placeholder screens created but may have missing imports
   - API client may have dependency issues

2. **Package Dependencies**: 
   - Some Expo/React Native packages may need version alignment
   - AsyncStorage import needs verification

#### **Admin Interface**
1. **React Version Conflicts**: React 19 vs React Native Web compatibility
   - Admin app creation failed due to peer dependency conflicts
   - Need to resolve React version mismatches

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE**

### **Priority 1 - API Routing** 
```bash
# Issue: Routes returning 404 in tests
# Fix: Verify middleware registration and JWT guard setup
cd backend/sports-yeti-api
php artisan route:list  # Check route registration
php artisan config:cache  # Clear config cache
```

### **Priority 2 - JWT Configuration**
