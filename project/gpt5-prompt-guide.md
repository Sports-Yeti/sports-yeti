GPT-5 Prompting Guide: Best Practices for General Usage

Introduction
GPT-5 represents a significant shift in how language models process and respond to prompts. Unlike previous models, GPT-5 is particularly sensitive to instruction structure, style, and tone. This guide extrapolates from coding-specific behaviors to provide comprehensive prompting strategies for all use cases.

Core Principles
1. Susceptibility to Instruction Style
GPT-5 is highly responsive to how you structure your prompts:

Be explicit about tone and style - The model adapts strongly to the communication style you establish
Use consistent formatting - Maintain uniform structure throughout your prompts
Define expectations clearly - GPT-5 performs better with well-defined parameters
2. Planning Before Execution
GPT-5 excels when given explicit planning phases:

Before responding, please:
1. Decompose the request into core components
2. Identify any ambiguities that need clarification
3. Create a structured approach to address each component
4. Validate your understanding before proceeding
Structured Prompting Techniques
The Spec Format
Define clear specifications for any behavior you want GPT-5 to follow:

<task_spec>
  Definition: [What exactly you want accomplished]
  When Required: [Conditions that trigger this behavior]
  Format & Style: [How the output should be structured]
  Sequence: [Step-by-step order of operations]
  Prohibited: [What to avoid]
  Handling Ambiguity: [How to deal with unclear inputs]
</task_spec>
Reasoning and Validation Steps
Always include these sections in complex prompts:

Pre-execution Reasoning: "Before starting, explain your understanding of the task and your approach"
Planning Phase: "Create a detailed plan with all sub-tasks identified"
Validation Checkpoints: "After each major step, verify the output meets requirements"
Post-action Review: "Confirm all objectives have been met before concluding"

Complete Task Resolution
For tasks requiring multiple steps or decisions:

Remember: Continue working until the entire request is fully resolved. 
- Decompose the query into ALL required sub-tasks
- Confirm each sub-task is completed before moving on
- Only conclude when you're certain the problem is fully solved
- Be prepared to handle follow-up questions without losing context
Preamble Explanations
Control when and how GPT-5 explains its actions:

For transparency without verbosity:

Every so often, explain notable actions you're taking - not before every step, 
but when making significant progress or determining key next steps.
For detailed explanations:

Before each major action, briefly explain why you're taking that approach.
Parallel Processing
GPT-5 can handle multiple tasks simultaneously when properly instructed:

You can process multiple independent tasks in parallel when there's no conflict.
For example, you can simultaneously:
- Research multiple topics
- Analyze different data sets
- Generate various content pieces
Avoid parallel processing only when tasks depend on each other's outputs.
Best Practices for Different Use Cases
Research and Analysis
1. Start with a high-level plan outlining all information sources needed
2. Gather data comprehensively before analysis
3. Present findings in a structured format with clear sections
4. Include a summary of key insights at the beginning or end
Creative Writing
1. Establish tone, style, and voice parameters upfront
2. Create an outline before writing
3. Maintain consistency throughout the piece
4. Review for coherence and flow before finalizing
Problem-Solving
1. Clearly state the problem and constraints
2. Generate multiple solution approaches
3. Evaluate pros and cons of each approach
4. Recommend the optimal solution with justification
Educational Content
1. Assess the audience's knowledge level
2. Structure information from foundational to advanced
3. Include examples and analogies
4. Provide checkpoints for understanding

TODO Tool Implementation
Consider implementing a mental TODO list structure:

Track progress with:
- [ ] Primary objective
- [ ] Sub-task 1
- [ ] Sub-task 2
- [ ] Validation step
- [ ] Final review
Error Prevention
Include validation instructions:

Before providing your final response:
1. Verify all requirements have been addressed
2. Check for internal consistency
3. Ensure the output format matches specifications
4. Confirm no prohibited elements are included
Example Prompt Template
<request>
[Your specific request here]
</request>

<instructions>
1. First, create a brief plan outlining your approach
2. Explain your reasoning for this approach
3. Execute the plan step by step
4. Validate each major output against the requirements
5. Provide a final summary confirming all objectives are met
</instructions>

<constraints>
- Verbosity: [low/medium/high]
- Style: [formal/casual/technical]
- Format: [paragraph/bullet points/structured sections]
</constraints>
